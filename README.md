Idea by Lucas
Idea:
  Rocket in space collects a currency
  Currency is used to buy upgrades to make you go faster through space or how much you collect
  The faster you go through space, the faster you collect the currency
  
  Every once in a while there would be a shooting star. A shooting star is a way for the user to get extra currency.
  The extra/bonus currency is very rewarding at the start of the game, but later on when the user has played for a while, the bonus is not as rewarding. Ex. At the start when the user is making 100 currency per second, a shooting star would reward something like 10 000 gold. Later on, when the user is making 20 000 currency per second, a shooting star would reward something like 60 000 currency. So, instead of a bonus increase of 100x gold, it would be only a 3x increase in gold.
  
  
This is crucial. The whole game will revolve around this:
  After every time the user buys an upgrade, the upgrade price would be multiplied based on an exponential function. So would the speed and currency per second. 

IDEA BOX
-After some ammount of time maybe the ship could discover planets or something, you could name them and maybe get bonus resources.
-add some upgrades that cost certain types of recourses not just currency.
