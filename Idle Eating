Sizes of food
  Milligram mg
  centigram cg = 10 milligrams
  decigram dg = 10 centigrams
  gram g = 10 decigrams           -- where the scaling actually starts, 1000 milligrams, 100 centigrams, 10 decigrams
  dekagram dag = 10 grams
  hectagram hg = 10 dekagrams
  kilogram kg = 10 hectagrams
  tonne t = 1000 kg
  megatonne mt = 1000 kg (not accurate, but for the sake of the apps incremental system, we need it to be 1000 not 1 million)
  gigatonne gt = 1000 mt (also not accurate)
  kilotonne kt = 1000 kt (^)
